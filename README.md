# Do you MEAN it?

Backend engineer brushing up on frontend tech, we're going to build a MEAN app!

If you're not familiar with that acronym, we're talking:
* MongoDB - NoSQL database
* Express.js - modular web application framework
* Angular - also a web application framework, we'll be using it client side
* Node.js - application runtime

Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) `npm install -g @angular/cli`



### Build

## Running the tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
